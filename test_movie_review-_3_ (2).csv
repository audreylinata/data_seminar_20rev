"Thee same movie over and over, thatÂ´s the MCU. The same repetitive jokes and villain, only with a different cape ... The story is boring and tries a lot to be something it is not!!!!","negative"
"I give it 3 stars for the huge effort, special effects and good acting. Overall it is a stupid film, bloated with self-importance and sentimentality, with poor pacing. Action scenes did not quite land with me, you know, superheroes throwing and punching stuff, who cares.","negative"

"A garbage with full of unpleasant characters and boring story and i call that a real charlatanism to stole your money and giving you a 3 hours long headache with minimum suspense and bad cgi and nothing more. i hope we never saw that characters anymore and never have such garbage anymore.","negative"
"Right in the beginning, you know how the movie is going to end...the good guys are going to win. How anti-climactic that was.. The stage is not set right (half of all humanity is gone, but the enormity of that is not explored...)...when you have Thanos give his explanation as to why he did what he did, I found myself thinking - well, he actually has a point. In the meanwhile, every single superhero is given time to fight, say some cute things, some say a few smart things, a few even manage to say profoundly philosophical statements... The quantum physics explanations used to explain how things are done, are plainly non sense... ..they just made stuff up as they went on. Alls well that ends well. Except we spent 3 hours to find that out.","negative"
"THE STORY IS VERY WELL BUILT THE CHEMISTRY OF THE CHARACTERS IS GREAT CGI IS GOOD THE PERFORMANCE IS GOOD IT WAS A GREAT LAST CHAPTER AFTER THIS FILM uDIDN'T WATCH ANYTHING ABOUT MARVEL BECAUSE NOW IT JUST MAKES GARBAGE.","positive"
"I don't really know what all the hype is about. Bored watching this as it's the same again just rehashed. Glad to see the back of the Avengers to be honest.","negative"
"Not a good film. Took me a few watches to realize.","negative"
"I went in with the highest expectations and came out underwhelmed and disappointed. its nowhere near as good as infinity war !!!","negative"
"One of the best superhero movies I have ever watched. All the actors really nailed their roles. Especially my one and only favorite iron man. Robert Downey Jr is irreplaceable in Iron man role.","positive"
"Honestly felt like a completely different film from Avengers Infinity War. In fact the film had such a different tone from all the Marvel films before. The characters changed, the story line was poor. Incredibly disappointing end to phase three","negative"
"Probably one of the worst Avengers movie to date. The plot was extremely childish and did not make sense. Completely went astray from the plot described in the comics. Very disappointed...","negative"
"Thank you Marvel, End Game is an ending that give me speechless.","positive"
"As always avengers didn't disappoint even with a few loops or inconsistencies. Hope marvel does more movies about some characters from avengers.","positive"
